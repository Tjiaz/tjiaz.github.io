Gravitational Wave Analysis and Detection 
---
In this implementation, an implementation is made on the analysis and detection of gravitational waves using spectrogram representation of the samples in the G2NET dataset.
The spectrogram of the wave signals are computed with the Constant Q Transform algorthim offered by nnAudio module.

Hourly/Minutes Bitcoin Prediction
---
In this project, two neural network models utilizing the LSTM algorithm both for regression and classification analysis on daily stock data were developed.

The purpose of this project is to formulate two neural network models that utilize the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) algorithm one of the variants of Recurrent Neural Network Algorithm for predicting the closing price value of BTC for the next day and for predicting the probability of rise or fall of a BTC for the next day respectively.
